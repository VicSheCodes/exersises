Object-oriented programming (OOP)
is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data,
in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures
(often known as methods).

Here are some key concepts in object-oriented programming:

1. **Class**:
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors
(methods) that objects of the class will have.

2. **Object**:
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity in the program's domain and
can interact with other objects and the system.

3. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data
into a single unit (class). It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world
and only exposes the necessary functionalities.

4. **Inheritance**:
Inheritance is a mechanism where a class (subclass or derived class) can inherit properties
and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and allows
the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

5. **Polymorphism**:
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
It enables a single interface to represent different data types or objects
and provides flexibility and extensibility in the code.

6. **Abstraction**:
Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling the relevant aspects
and hiding unnecessary details. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces,
which define a set of methods without providing implementations.

7. **Composition**:
Composition is a design principle where a class can contain objects of other classes as components.
It allows building complex objects by combining simpler ones
and establishes the "has-a" relationship between objects.

8. **Aggregation**:
Aggregation is a special form of composition where objects are associated with each other,
but the lifetime of the contained objects is not dependent on the containing object.
It represents a "has-a" relationship similar to composition but with weaker ownership semantics.

9. Message Passing:
In OOP, objects communicate with each other by sending messages.
A message is a request for a particular object to perform one of its methods.
This decouples the sender from the receiver and promotes loose coupling between objects.

10. Overloading and Overriding:
Overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name
but different parameters within the same class. Overriding is the ability
of a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

These concepts form the foundation of object-oriented programming
and are used to design and implement modular, reusable, and maintainable software systems.
