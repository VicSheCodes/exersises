Here are some workflow tips for working within the Qualified IDE:

The "Run Tests" button will execute all tests using the unittest runner.
Feel free to click “Run Tests” as many times as you want, some basic tests have been provided for you.
Feel free to log information to STDOUT while running tests to better understand the data you are working with.
Feel free to add your own tests to aid your process
Once you are ready to submit your final solution, don’t forget to clean up your debugging statements before submitting.
