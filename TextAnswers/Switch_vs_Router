Certainly:

1. Functionality:
   - Switch operates at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
   - Router operates at the Network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.

2. Addressing:
   - Switch forwards packets based on MAC addresses.
   - Router forwards packets based on IP addresses.

3. Broadcast Handling:
   - Switch forwards broadcasts within the same VLAN.
   - Router does not forward broadcasts by default.

4. Subnet Handling:
   - Switch does not understand IP subnets; it operates within a single subnet.
   - Router can connect multiple subnets and facilitate communication between them.

5. Scope of Operation:
   - Switch operates within a LAN (Local Area Network).
   - Router connects multiple networks and can operate within a LAN or WAN (Wide Area Network).
